# My Metacrafters beginner Solidity project

This solidity program is a simple  nft token minting and burning program. The purpose of this program is to show what i learned from the "Getting Started with Solidity" Course in Metacrafters

# Description

This program is written in solidity and has a contract that contains two functions, namely , mint and burn. The mint function mints a number of tokens based on the user's input to the provided address and total_value variable in the program. The burn function does the opposite of mint function, wherein it removes or "burns" a number of tokens stored in the total_value variable and the tokens minted from the supplied address. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., My_token.sol). Copy and paste the code stored in the Solidity_Project_Token.sol file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MYTOKEN" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is now deployed, you can now interact with the mint and burn function. You can also interact with the declared variables to display their values.
